Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading (including ones to YouTube videos).

<h2 align="center">Data Structures</h2>

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

<h2 align="center">Algorithms</h2>

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.
